## Example outputs
    reverseString('Some String') will return 'gnirtS emoS'.
    reverseString(JavaScript) will return 'tpircSavaJ'.

## How I solved it 1
    Write a function that takes in a string.
    Create a variable to hold the reversed string.
    Iterate through each letter via a for loop.
    For each iteration, add it to the front of the string.
    Return the reversed string.

## How I solved it 2
    Write a function that takes in a string.
    Using high-order methods, split the string into individual letters in an array.
    Use reverse() to reverse the array.
    Use join() to join the aray back together into a reversed string.
    Return the result.
